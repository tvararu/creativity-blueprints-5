Creativity Blueprints 5
===

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/tvararu/creativity-blueprints-5.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
This is a little single-page static website I developed for [Advice](http://www.advicestudents.ro/) in early 2013. I built it using [Roots](https://github.com/jenius/roots) and [Impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/). I **wouldn't** recommend using Impress to build any remotely similar website (there's a [much better alternative](https://github.com/jmpressjs/jmpress.js) for that), but I wholeheartedly **would** recommend Roots for small static websites and prototypes.

Expect to find a lot of hacks and ugly code that was written the night before the final deadline. That said, the reason I considered uploading this is because I figured it could be of use to someone looking for a real example of either an Impress or a Roots website.

### Installation
The latest version of this project was confirmed to compile on Roots **v2.1.3**. So, make sure you have that version:

```bash
npm install roots@2.1.3
```

Then, clone as usual, and start the watcher:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tvararu/creativity-blueprints-5.git cb5
cd cb5
roots watch
```
