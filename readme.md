[Creativity Blueprints 5](http://creativityblueprints.ro/)
=================
This is a little single-page static website I developed for [Advice](http://www.advicestudents.ro/) in early 2013. I built it using [Roots](https://github.com/jenius/roots) and [Impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/). I **wouldn't** recommend using Impress to build any remotely similar website (there's a [much better alternative](https://github.com/jmpressjs/jmpress.js) for that), but I wholeheartedly **would** recommend Roots for small static websites and prototypes.

Expect to find a lot of hacks and ugly code that was written the night before the final deadline. That said, the reason I considered uploading this is because I figured it could be of use to someone looking for a real example of either an Impress or a Roots website.

### Installation
Install Roots, then:
```
git clone https://github.com/tvararu/creativity-blueprints-5.git cb5
cd cb5
roots watch
```
